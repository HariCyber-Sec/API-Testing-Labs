   # 🔍 API Security Testing Labs

This repository showcases my hands-on learning journey through API security testing — focused on real-world offensive techniques like parameter tampering, server-side parameter pollution (SSPP), and mass assignment vulnerabilities.

All tasks were performed as part of a structured training path, with lab-based scenarios inspired by real bug bounty findings and OWASP API Security Top 10 vulnerabilities.

I documented each step using tools like Burp Suite, Postman, and custom Python scripts, simulating attacker behavior on test APIs to understand the underlying logic flaws and weak access controls.

This project not only helped me refine my API recon and security automation skills, but also taught me how hidden parameters, unsanitized inputs, and weak object-level authorization can lead to high-severity exploits.
