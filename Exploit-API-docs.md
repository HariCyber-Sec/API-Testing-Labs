# Lab: Exploiting an API Endpoint Using Documentation
üìç **Platform:** PortSwigger Web Security Academy  
üìÖ **Date Completed:** March 1, 2025  
üéØ **Objective:** Leverage publicly exposed API documentation to discover sensitive endpoints and perform unauthorized operations (in this case user deletion).  
‚úÖ **Status:** Successfully completed

---

## üß† Overview

This lab illustrates a common API security misconfiguration ‚Äî **exposing internal or sensitive API operations through publicly available documentation**, such as Swagger or Postman collections.

By discovering accessible API specifications, we identified undocumented functionality and used it to perform an unauthorized `DELETE` operation on another user account.

## üîç Detailed Methodology

1. **Logged into the Application**

Accessed the lab web application.
Logged in using the provided default credentials:
Username: wiener
Password: peter

---
2.**Captured the Email Update API Request**

Navigated to **My Account > Email Update** section.
Updated the email address to trigger an API request.
Captured the following request in Burp Suite:
PATCH /api/user/wiener
Sent the request to **Burp Repeater** for further manipulation.

---
3.**Discovered the API Documentation**

Modified the request path in Repeater to probe for accessible endpoints:
- Tried `/api/user` ‚Üí response was a generic error.
- Tried `/api` ‚Üí returned an HTML page.
Opened the response in browser.
Swagger UI was exposed, revealing full API documentation.

---
4.**Executed DELETE Request from API Docs**

In the Swagger interface, located the `DELETE /api/user/{username}` endpoint.
Entered `carlos` as the target username.
Sent the request directly from the Swagger UI.
Response confirmed that user `carlos` was deleted successfully.

---
5.**Result**

On successful deletion of `carlos`, the lab environment confirmed completion.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **Burp Suite** ‚Äì for intercepting and modifying HTTP requests  
- **Browser Dev Tools** ‚Äì for initial recon and interface inspection  
- **Swagger/OpenAPI Viewer** ‚Äì to analyze the exposed documentation

## üí° Key Takeaways

- API documentation should **never be exposed** in production environments.
- Proper **authentication and role-based authorization** must be enforced for sensitive operations like `DELETE`.
- Swagger/OpenAPI tools can unintentionally reveal dangerous endpoints if not secured.
